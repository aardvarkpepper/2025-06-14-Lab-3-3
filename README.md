# Reflection

After completing these challenges, take a few minutes to answer the following questions:

1.  How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?

Figma design components have specific information including element size, orientation, hexadecimal color, and font.  I used this information to get exact values for variables in the coding process.

2.  What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?


3.  How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

It looks like Frontend Mentor may have tools to assess accuracy of submitted challenges; I would imagine it would offer specific feedback on what things were missed.  Feedback and community resources are always useful to developers, as getting outside feedback is always useful.

## Reference Notes

Note:  Bootstrap version has been updated since lab reference created.  If components do not work, change to current version.
